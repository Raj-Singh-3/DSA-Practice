Recursion is the programming equivalent of mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is a way of defining something in terms of itself.
A Function that calls itself.
Recursion is usually used because it simplifies a problem conceptually, not because it’s inherently more efficient

write the trecurrence relation if needed and always made recursive tree.

Characteristics of Recursive Methods
 • It calls itself.
 • When it calls itself, it does so to solve a smaller problem.
 • There’s some version of the problem that is simple enough that the routine can
   solve it, and return, without calling itself
