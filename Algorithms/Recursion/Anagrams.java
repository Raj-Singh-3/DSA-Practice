Anagrams
 Here’s a different kind of situation in which recursion provides a neat solution to a
 problem. A permutation is an arrangement of things in a definite order. Suppose you
 want to list all the anagrams of a specified word—that is, all possible permutations
 (whether they make a real English word or not) that can be made from the letters of
 the original word. We’ll call this anagramming a word. Anagramming cat, for
 example, would produce
 • cat
 • cta
 • atc
 • act
 • tca
 • tac
